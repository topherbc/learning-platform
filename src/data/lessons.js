    introduction: 'Welcome to Python Learning! Let\'s start with variables. In Python, you can create a variable by using a name and the assignment operator (=).\n\nTry creating a variable named \'message\' with the value "Hello, Python!" like this:\n\nmessage = "Hello, Python!"',
    expectedResponse: 'message = "Hello, Python!"',
    hint: 'Make sure to use double quotes and match the exact message.',
    completion: 'Great! You\'ve created your first variable. In Python, variables are like containers that store data.'

    topic: 'Print Statement',
    introduction: 'Now let\'s learn how to display values using print(). The print function outputs text to the screen.\n\nTry printing the message "Hello, World!" like this:\n\nprint("Hello, World!")',
    expectedResponse: 'print("Hello, World!")',
    hint: 'Remember to use print() with parentheses and quotes around the text.',
    completion: 'Excellent! print() is one of the most commonly used functions in Python.'

    topic: 'Basic Operations',
    introduction: 'Python can perform mathematical operations. Let\'s try addition.\n\nAdd two numbers: 5 + 3',
    expectedResponse: '5 + 3',
    hint: 'Simply type the numbers with a plus sign between them.',
    completion: 'Perfect! Python supports all basic mathematical operations: +, -, *, and /.'

    topic: 'Conditional Statements',
    introduction: 'Conditional statements let us make decisions in code. Here\'s a simple if statement:\n\nTry writing: if x > 0: print("Positive")',
    expectedResponse: 'if x > 0: print("Positive")',
    hint: 'Make sure to include the colon (:) after the condition.',
    completion: 'Well done! Conditional statements are fundamental for controlling program flow.'
