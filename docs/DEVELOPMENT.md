# Development Workflow 

## Iterative Process
1. Plan
   - Define clear, small goals for each iteration
   - Prioritize features based on user needs
2. Implement 
   - Develop the planned features
   - Keep changes small and focused
3. Test
   - Manually test the new functionality
   - Get feedback from users
4. Review
   - Analyze user feedback and metrics
   - Identify areas for improvement
5. Repeat
   - Incorporate learnings into next iteration plan
   - Continue cycle

## Best Practices  
- Use feature branches for all changes
- Open pull request early for feedback
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Maintain a clean, linear commit history
- Regularly merge main into feature branches  
- Perform code reviews before merging
- Keep main branch in deployable state

## Issue Tracking
- Create issues for all bugs and enhancements 
- Apply relevant labels (bug, feature, etc)
- Reference issues in commit messages
- Close issues via pull requests
- Use milestones for longer-term planning

## Deployment
- Automate deployments where possible 
- Use staging environment for testing
- Perform manual QA on staging
- Deploy to prod outside of peak hours
- Monitor error logs and metrics post-deploy
